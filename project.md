# Calendar Kiosk Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a **calendar kiosk** designed for convenient scheduling and event viewing.

## Display Options
One of the key decision points in the design process is selecting the appropriate display technology: **e-ink** or a **traditional color display**.

### **E-Ink Display**
#### ✅ Pros:
- Crisp black-and-white display.
- Extremely low power consumption.
- Can operate on battery power for **3 to 6 months** without recharging.

#### ❌ Cons:
- No full-color capability.
- Screensaver mode may only support **grainy images** or simple static content.
- No touch interactive capabilities.
- Limited additional features—primarily functions as a **calendar display**.

### **Traditional Color Display**
##### ✅ Pros:
- Full-color.
- Interactive touch capabilities example click to expand weather
- Can support additional features and applications(Picture screen saver, music, etc).

##### ❌ Cons:
- Requires **regular charging** or a **constant power source**.
- If used unplugged, the battery may only last **a few hours to a couple of days**.

## Mountin Options
**Wall-Mounted Display** or **Desktop Stand Display**

### ***Wall-Mount***
- Dedicated Wall-Mount could be in-wall and flush with the wall, which would require some handyman work and electrical or low voltage ie POE(Power of Ethernet) considerations.
- Surface wall mount would not require the same electrical or lower voltage considerations, and could be more flexible

### ***Desktop Stand***

## Summary
- Decide on E-Ink vs Color Display
- Decide if it is going to be wall mounted or will use a desktop/table top stand
